**********************************************************************


I-Mutant2.0 is a Support Vector Machine -based web server for the automatic
prediction of protein stability changes upon single-site mutations. The tool
was trained on a data set derived from ProTherm [1] that is presently the 
most comprehensive database of experimental data on protein mutations. Our 
predictor can evaluate the stability change upon single site mutation starting
from the protein structure or from the protein sequence. When trained/tested 
with a cross validation procedure, I-Mutant2.0 correctly predicts whether the 
protein mutation stabilises or destabilises the protein in 80% of the cases 
when the three-dimensional structure is known and 77% of the cases when only 
the protein sequence is available.


Results

In the table some scoring indexes of the efficiency of the method are listed. The protein stability change is predicted from the structure (I-Mutant2.0-PDB) or from the sequence (I-Mutant2.0-Seq).

	
           		Q2	P(+)	Q(+)	P(-)	Q(-)  	 C
I-Mutant2.0-PDB       0.80      0.73    0.56    0.83    0.91  0.51
I-Mutant2.0-Seq       0.77      0.69    0.46    0.79    0.91  0.42


The overall accuracy Q2 is:

   Q2=p/N

where p is the total number of correctly predicted residues and N is the
total number of residues. The correlation coefficient C is defined as:

   C(s)=[ p(s)n(s)-u(s)o(s) )] / D


where D is the normalization factor

   D =[(p(s)+u(s))(p(s)+o(s))(n(s)+u(s))(n(s)+o(s))]1/2

for each class s (+ and -, for increasing and decreasing stability,
respectively); p(s) and n(s) are the total number of correct predictions
and correctly rejected assignments, respectively, and u(s) and o(s) are
the numbers of under and over predictions.
The coverage for each discriminated structure s is evaluated as:

   Q(s)=p(s)/[ p(s)+u(s)]

where p(s) and u(s) are used in previous equations The probability of correct
predictions P(s) (or accuracy for s) is computed as:

   P(s)=p(s) / [p(s) + o(s)]

where p(s) and o(s) are previous defined (ranging from 1 to 0).




REQUIRED INPUTS
I-Mutant2.0 is optimized to predict the protein stability change upon
mutation either starting from the protein structure (Task 1) or the
protein sequence (Task 2). In both cases, the end-user can predict the
protein stability change corresponding to all possible mutations of a
particular residue, or ask only for a specific mutation. In either case,
I-Mutant2.0 can predict the direction of the free energy change and its
value. If the end-user requires only one single prediction, instead of
19 possible mutations in a given position, the option ?New residue? may
be selected.

Task 1) When the structure of the protein under study is known the
following inputs are necessary:
	
	1) PDB code: the PDB protein code [2];
   	2) Chain: if the input is a PDB file containing more than one
      	   chain, the chain label is also necessary; otherwise the default
           value is "_";
        3) Position: the PDB position number of the residue that undergoes
      	   mutation;
        4) Temperature: the Temperature value in Celsius degrees [0-100];
        5) pH: the negative logarithm value of H+ concentration [0-14].

Task 2) When only the protein sequence is available the required inputs are:

        1) Protein Sequence: the protein sequence in raw format and one
      	   letter code;
   	2) Position: the position number in the sequence of the residue
      	   that undergoes mutation;
    	3) Temperature: the Temperature value in Celsius degrees [0-100];
    	4) pH: the negative logarithm value of H+ concentration [0-14].


The program can be used both by command line or interactively.

In the first case you have to provide the previous information specifying
if prediction is performed starting from structural information or from 
sequence information.
If you a pdb structure is available the input of the program would be

    python -O I-Mutant2.0.py -pdb pdbfile dsspfile chain position newres <pH> <Temperature>

otherwise if only sequence information are provided the input is
	
    python -O I-Mutant2.0.py -seq seqfile position newres <pH> <Temperature>

In Test directory we provide two examples that can be tested as 
	
on UNIX:	
  python -O  I-Mutant2.0.py -pdb Test/1cei.pdb Test/1cei.dssp _ 17 A 8.0 35.0
  python -O  I-Mutant2.0.py -pdb Test/1cei.pdb Test/1cei.dssp _ 17 A
or
  python -O  I-Mutant2.0.py -seq Test/1cei.seq _ 17 A 8.0 35.0
  python -O  I-Mutant2.0.py -seq Test/1cei.seq _ 17 A
	
on WINDOWS:    
  python -O  I-Mutant1.0.py Test\1cei.pdb Test\1cei.dssp _ 17 A  8.0 35.0	
  python -O  I-Mutant1.0.py Test\1cei.pdb Test\1cei.dssp _ 17 A
or
  python -O  I-Mutant2.0.py -seq Test\1cei.seq _ 17 A 8.0 35.0
  python -O  I-Mutant2.0.py -seq Test\1cei.seq _ 17 A
	
In the former case all the command line options are set,
while in the latter default temperature and pH values are used.
In both cases you should obtain the computed stability changes 
for the 19 possible mutations of the residue 17 in protein 1CEI. 

In order to use I-Mutant in an interactive way you have only to type 

   python -O  I-Mutant1.0.py

and the program will ask you the parameters it needs.


OUTPUTS
The output consists of a table listing the sign and the value of the 
predicted stability changes upon the 19 possible mutations for a given
PDB or sequence position.

The RSA value (Relative Solvent Accessible Area) is extracted from the
DSSP[3] file. It is obtained dividing the surface area calculated by the
relative amino acid surface [4].

The RI value (Reliability Index) is calculated from the output of the neural
network Oi as

RI=20*abs(O-0.5)



WARNING!!! Check your pdb/dssp files!
Possible errors may occur when PDB files contain broken chains or an 
unexpected residue numbering.

REQUIREMENTS
I-Mutant needs python2.X version (or higher) and the Numeric package.
